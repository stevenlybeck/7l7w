Had to install macports and then use 'sudo port install gprolog'. Because I had earlier tried to install using the pkg available for gprolog, macports refused to activate, saying 'Error: org.macports.activate for port gprolog returned: Image error: /opt/local/bin/fd2c already exists and does not belong to a registered port.'. This was fixed by running 'sudo port -f activate gprolog', as suggested in the error message. Additionally, at some point it was useful to run 'sudo port clean gprolog' to reset the whole installation procedure when I was having weird errors.
